        The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Record First Quarter Results

      - Significant Increase in Sales and Earnings Due to Acquisition of
        Multifoods

      - Integration of Multifoods' Operations on Track

      - Board of Directors Authorizes Share Repurchase

      - Company Confirms Fiscal Year 2005 Outlook

    ORRVILLE, Ohio, Aug. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company
(NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2004,
of its 2005 fiscal year. Results for the quarter include the operations of
International Multifoods Corporation (Multifoods) since the acquisition closing
date of June 18, 2004.

    As previously announced, the Company sold its Australian based Henry Jones
Foods (HJF) business and is planning to divest the U.S. foodservice business
acquired as part of the Multifoods transaction. Results for both of these
businesses are reported as discontinued operations and all prior periods have
been restated. Quarterly restated results for fiscal year 2004 are included.

    First Quarter Results

    Company sales were $415.8 million for the first quarter of 2005, up 22
percent compared to $341.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. The acquired
Multifoods' businesses contributed $75.5 million to sales in the first quarter
of 2005. Excluding the contribution of the Multifoods' brands, higher sales of
branded products were offset by declines in non-branded industrial sales. Income
from continuing operations was $27.5 million, an increase of nine percent over
$25.2 million in last year's first quarter, while earnings per diluted share for
the quarter were $0.50 in both years, due to the additional shares issued in the
Multifoods transaction.

    Improved margins on the Company's existing business and the addition of
Multifoods were the primary causes for the earnings increase.  These increases
were partially offset by higher interest expense, associated with debt related
to the acquisition.  Income from continuing operations for the first quarter
of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $2.8 million or $0.03
per diluted share and restructuring charges of $3.0 million or $0.04 per
diluted share.  Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of
2004 included restructuring charges of $3.2 million or $0.04 per diluted
share.  Excluding these merger and integration and restructuring costs, the
Company's income from continuing operations was up 14 percent and diluted
earnings per share would have been $0.57 and $0.54, in the first quarter of
2005 and 2004, respectively.

    "We closed the acquisition of Multifoods this quarter and are pleased to
see its contribution reflected in our first quarter results.  With the
addition of Multifoods, we have added an impressive array of leading, North
American icon brands to the family of Smucker," said Tim Smucker, chairman and
co-chief executive officer.  "We have already started to invest behind these
brands and the integration of the businesses is well underway."

    Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was up 27 percent to
$32.8 million or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to last year's first
quarter net income of $25.8 million or $0.51 per diluted share.  Included in
this quarter's net income was income from discontinued operations of
$5.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share, which includes the gain on the
Company's sale of its HJF business.  Income from discontinued operations was
$0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share last year.

    The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding
restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure
of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally.
These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of
financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, management believes the
presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information
to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and
provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results.  A
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for
the current quarter is included in the "Financial Highlights" table.

    Scottsville Plant

    During the first quarter of 2005, construction of the Smucker's
Uncrustables(R) plant in Scottsville, Kentucky, was completed and the plant
commenced operations.  The new facility has experienced a longer ramp-up
schedule than originally anticipated.  The Company incurred approximately
$2.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share in costs associated with the start-up
during the first quarter of 2005.  These costs consist primarily of additional
labor, materials, and under-absorbed overhead.  The Company expects to incur
additional start-up costs for the year, with a majority of the costs to be
incurred during the second quarter.  The Company plans to offset these costs
with cost reductions across the organization, and is not changing its fiscal
year earnings guidance.

    "We view this ramp-up issue as a short-term hurdle and continue to be
excited about Uncrustables as a growth platform for the Company over the next
several years," commented Richard Smucker, president, co-chief executive
officer and chief financial officer.  "We continue to support Uncrustables
with additional promotion and marketing activities this year and anticipate a
significant year-over-year sales increase."

    Margins

    Operating income in the first quarter increased 16 percent from the
comparable quarter last year, while operating margin decreased from
12.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004 to 11.6 percent in the first quarter
of 2005.  The increase in operating income was attributed to the overall
revenue growth.  The Company's gross margin increased slightly from
34.6 percent in the first quarter of last year to 34.8 percent in the first
quarter of this year, due primarily to the impact of the Company's supply
chain optimization project, favorable manufacturing costs, and a decrease in
restructuring charges.

    The Company continues to see escalating raw material costs.  Increases in
the cost of certain fruit varieties and rising fuel costs, which primarily
affect packaging components as well as energy costs, are the key contributors.
The Company expects to offset these increases in raw material costs over the
remainder of the year through a variety of cost reduction and pricing
measures.

    Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses as a percentage
of sales declined slightly from 22.0 percent in the first quarter of 2004 to
21.9 percent in the current quarter.  Marketing and selling expenses decreased
as a percent of sales despite an absolute dollar increase of 11 percent.  This
was somewhat offset by administrative costs being incurred at the former
Multifoods' headquarters in Minnesota, which is expected to be closed by the
end of April 2005.

    Interest expense increased from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2004
to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of an increase in the
Company's debt outstanding associated with the acquisition of Multifoods.  The
Company's first quarter earnings benefited from a decrease in the effective
tax rate from 37.5 percent in 2004 to 36.6 percent this quarter.

    Segment Performance

    U.S. Retail Market

    The U.S. retail market segment is comprised of the Company's consumer and
consumer oils and baking business areas.  Prior to the acquisition of
Multifoods, this segment represented the domestic sales of Smucker's(R),
Jif(R), and Crisco(R) branded products to retail customers.  With the addition
of Multifoods, domestic sales of Pillsbury(R), Hungry Jack(R), Martha
White(R), and Pet(R) branded products to retail customers are now included in
this segment.

    Sales in the U.S. retail market segment for the first quarter of 2005 were
$288.1 million, compared to $248.3 million in the first quarter of 2004, an
increase of 16 percent.  The Multifoods' brands contributed $39.9 million of
the segment's sales in the quarter.

    During the first quarter of 2005, sales in the consumer area increased
11 percent over the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in the
Smucker's and Jif brands, the addition of Hungry Jack, and continued growth of
the Company's Uncrustables products.  In the consumer oils and baking area,
sales were up 29 percent due to the addition of the Pillsbury and Martha White
brands.  Crisco branded sales in retail were down approximately six percent
during the quarter, an improvement from the fourth quarter of last year.  In
addition, non-branded industrial oil sales were down from the prior year.


    Special Markets

    The special markets segment is comprised of the international,
foodservice, beverage, industrial, and Canada strategic business areas.  The
Canadian business acquired from Multifoods has been combined with the
Company's previous Canadian business to form the new Canada business area.

    Sales in the special markets segment were $127.7 million in the first
quarter of 2005, compared to $93.6 million for the first quarter of 2004.
Multifoods contributed $35.6 million of the segment's sales in the quarter.
Sales in the Canada and foodservice business areas were up over the prior
year's first quarter.  Excluding the Multifoods sales and planned declines in
the industrial and international businesses, special markets increased four
percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the comparable period last
year.

    Foodservice sales, which exclude the Multifoods' U.S. foodservice
business, were up four percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared to last
year's first quarter.  Growth in the Company's traditional portion control
business and increased Uncrustables sales in the school market contributed to
the overall increase in foodservice sales.

    Beverage sales were down three percent in the first quarter of 2005
compared to the first quarter of 2004, due mostly to a decrease in sales of
Santa Cruz Organic(R) products.  Availability of certain organic raw materials
was the primary cause of the decline.  Sales of R. W. Knudsen Family(R)
products and the non-branded business segment were up for the first quarter of
2005 versus the first quarter of last year.

    Finally, industrial sales were down 14 percent in the first quarter of
2005 compared to the prior year's first quarter.  The decrease in the
industrial area was due to the final phase of the Company's plan to exit low
margin contracts.  Approximately $3.4 million in sales of now discontinued
business were included in last year's first quarter.  Sales that are planned
to be discontinued are estimated at $11 million for the entire fiscal year.

    Share Repurchase

    At its most recent meeting, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a
share repurchase plan.  Under the plan, the Company is authorized to purchase
up to one million common shares.  The buyback program will be implemented
throughout the fiscal year and beyond, at management's discretion.

    Outlook for Fiscal 2005

    The Company confirmed its objective to increase its 2005 diluted earnings
per share from continuing operations by its long-term growth goal of eight
percent, taking into consideration the previously discussed cost increases.
This equates to an earnings growth rate of approximately 24 percent in 2005.
An increase of approximately eight million shares outstanding resulting from
the Multifoods acquisition accounts for the difference in these growth rates.
This earnings goal excludes the impacts of restructuring, merger and
integration costs, and gains and losses on sales of assets.

    With the decision to divest the Multifoods' U.S. foodservice business and
treat it as a discontinued operation, forecasted sales for 2005 have been
revised to approximately $2.1 billion.

    Earnings for 2005 will include approximately $20 million or $0.20 per
diluted share in merger and integration costs and approximately $6.5 million
or $0.07 per diluted share in restructuring costs.  This is an increase over
the previously announced estimate of restructuring charges and primarily
reflects the Company's first quarter decision to relocate some production from
its Salinas, California, facility to plants in Orrville, Ohio, and Memphis,
Tennessee.

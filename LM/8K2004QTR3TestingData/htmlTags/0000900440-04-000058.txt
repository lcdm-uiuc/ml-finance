                                                           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CONAGRA FOODS  REPORTS  STRONG FIRST  QUARTER  SALES WITH SOLID  PROFITS;  SHARE
REPURCHASES CONTINUED DURING THE QUARTER

HIGHLIGHTS:
- -----------

o    First quarter  fiscal 2005 sales rose 8% to $3.5 billion,  driven mostly by
     strong volume performance in the Retail Products segment.

o    First quarter  fiscal 2005 diluted EPS of $0.26 includes $0.02 per share of
     previously announced costs related to implementing efficiency initiatives.

o    First quarter fiscal 2004 diluted EPS of $0.37 included  contribution  from
     businesses   the  company  no  longer   owns  and  other  items   affecting
     year-over-year comparisons. Those items are detailed toward the end of this
     release.

o    Almost seven million  shares were  repurchased  during the first quarter of
     fiscal 2005 for approximately $181 million.

OMAHA,  Neb.,  Sept.  22, 2004 -- ConAgra Foods Inc.  (NYSE:  CAG), one of North
America's leading packaged food companies, today reported earnings for the first
quarter  ended Aug. 29, 2004.  Net income for the quarter was $135  million,  or
$0.26 per diluted share,  and includes  $0.02 per share of previously  announced
costs related to  implementing  efficiency  initiatives.  Earnings for the first
quarter  last year were $195  million,  or $0.37 per diluted  share,  reflecting
contribution  from businesses the company no longer owns, as well as other items
that impact year-over-year comparability.

Sales for the company  increased 8% to $3.5 billion from $3.2 billion last year.
Current  quarter  operating  profit was $341 million,  9% above the $312 million
reported last year.  Current  quarter income from continuing  operations  before
income tax and the cumulative  effect of changes in accounting was $214 million,
29% ahead of $166 million last fiscal year.

Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "Our first quarter
sales were very strong, reflecting excellent volumes for many of our brands. Our
sales and marketing  initiatives are gaining  significant  momentum,  and we are
pleased with the progress."

Rohde  continued,  "And because we have taken some price  increases  and reduced
operating  expenses in several areas, our overall  operating profit this quarter
was  solid,  but it was not as  strong  as we  wanted;  this was  mainly  due to
significantly  increased  input costs  across the  industry.  As we plan for the
balance of this fiscal year, we expect to continue  making price  adjustments to
offset  increased  input  costs,  as well as to  continue  growing  volumes  and
capitalizing  on  cost  savings  opportunities  so that  we  strengthen  margins
throughout the year."

                      Retail Products (58% of total sales)

Sales for the Retail Products segment increased 9% to $2 billion,  the result of
8% volume growth.

o    Brands posting sales gains include: ACT II, Armour,  Banquet,  Blue Bonnet,
     Butterball,  Chef Boyardee,  Cook's,  DAVID,  Eckrich, Egg Beaters,  Hebrew
     National,  Hunt's, Kid Cuisine,  Manwich,  Marie Callender's,  PAM, Parkay,
     Peter Pan,  Reddi-wip,  Swiss Miss, and Wesson;  many of these increased at
     double-digit rates.

o    Sales for the company's top 30 brands as a group,  which  represent  almost
     80% of total segment sales,  grew 9%; category share trends for many of the
     company's most significant brands showed solid year-over-year improvement.

The  strong  volume  performance   reflects   disciplined  sales  and  marketing
initiatives designed to continually strengthen brand equities, increase category
shares,  expand  distribution,  optimize  return on  marketing  investment,  and
improve  profit  contribution  from new items.  The company  notes that  segment
volume  performance  in the first quarter last fiscal year was soft,  reflecting
the consolidation of the Retail Products sales force underway at that time. This
consolidation,  now  complete,  reduced  the role of brokers  and  resulted in a
direct approach for serving customers.  That transition has resulted in improved
sales  execution,  which  contributed  to the  strong  volume  performance  this
quarter.  During the quarter,  the segment's selling prices increased  slightly,
which only partly offset higher input costs; additional price increases continue
to be implemented to address increased raw material costs.

The Retail Products  segment  operating profit for the quarter was $213 million,
3% above the $208  million  posted  last  year,  reflecting  the  strong  volume
performance  and a focus on  operating  cost  reduction in the face of increased
input costs.  Significantly  increased input costs negatively impacted operating
profit  growth and profit  margin,  as did $8 million of costs  associated  with
implementing  efficiency  initiatives.  Profits for branded processed meats were
significantly  below prior year results,  reflecting a combination  of increased
costs and competitive challenges. The company expects price increases as well as
the  marketing  and operating  initiatives  underway to  accelerate  the rate of
operating profit growth for this segment as the fiscal year progresses.


                    Foodservice Products (26% of total sales)

Sales for the  Foodservice  Products  segment  were $905  million  for the first
quarter,  an  increase of 3% over last year,  reflecting  price  increases  that
offset increased input costs.  Sales for specialty potato and culinary  products
grew, while seafood sales declined due to market  conditions.  Segment operating
profit for the quarter was $67  million,  11% below the $76 million  posted last
year, largely due to $11 million of unfavorable production costs associated with
a  planned  plant  consolidation.  Results  also  include  $5  million  of costs
associated with implementing efficiency  initiatives.  The company expects price
increases  as  well as the  marketing  and  operating  initiatives  underway  to
accelerate  the rate of operating  profit  growth for this segment as the fiscal
year progresses.

                      Food Ingredients (16% of total sales)

During the quarter, sales for the Food Ingredients segment increased 14% to $577
million from $508 million last year.  Operating  profit more than doubled to $60
million this year. The strong sales and operating profit increases are primarily
the result of a favorable environment for input merchandising operations.  Sales
and operating profit results for the value-added  specialty  ingredients product
lines were essentially equal to those of a year ago.

Earnings from Equity Method Investments
Equity  method  investment  earnings for the quarter were $14 million,  compared
with $11 million for the same quarter last year.

Capital Resource Management & Corporate Expense
o    The company  repurchased nearly seven million shares of common stock during
     the first  quarter at a total cost of  approximately  $181  million.  Since
     announcing a $1 billion  share  repurchase  program in December  2003,  the
     company has repurchased approximately 22 million shares for a total cost of
     approximately $600 million.

o    Capital  expenditures  for  property,  plant,  and  equipment  totaled $105
     million  compared  with $71 million last year;  the increase over last year
     reflects  additional  investment in information  systems.  Depreciation and
     amortization  expense was  approximately $89 million for the quarter versus
     $85 million a year ago.  Dividends paid totaled $135 million.  Net interest
     expense  for the quarter was $73  million  compared  with $65 million  last
     year.

o    Corporate  expense  was $67  million  for the  quarter,  compared  with $92
     million last year.  Prior year amounts  include  approximately  $22 million
     related to a litigation settlement.

New Product News
During the quarter the company announced its whole-grain flour, Ultragrain White
Whole  Wheat,   its   proprietary   product  that  the  company  expects  to  be
revolutionary  in the  baking  industry.  Ultragrain  combines  the  nutritional
benefits of whole grains with the taste,  texture, and finished-baked  qualities
of refined flour that consumers and bakers often prefer.  Ultragrain can be used
in many applications including: bread, pizza crusts, pastas, tortillas,  snacks,
and cereals among other uses.  Initial  inquiries from potential trade customers
including food manufacturers,  bakeries,  and ingredients companies suggest that
the product has significant potential.

Also during the quarter,  Banquet  Crock-Pot  Classics,  the first complete meal
designed  and  created  for   Crock-Pot   slow   cooking,   reached   nationwide
distribution, and is off to strong start. Banquet Crock-Pot Classics contain all
of the  high-quality  ingredients  needed for a  slow-cooked  meal--like  tender
meats, fresh vegetables, hearty potatoes, and perfectly seasoned sauces--and are
ready to cook with less than five minutes of  preparation,  providing  consumers
with a convenient, on-demand homemade family meal.

Outlook
The company  believes that the marketing  and  operating  initiatives  currently
being  implemented,  along  with  appropriate  price  increases,  and the  share
repurchase  program,  will drive a solid EPS  performance  this fiscal year; the
company  expects the  benefit of its  profit-enhancing  initiatives  and pricing
actions  to be more  apparent  in the  company's  profit  margins  (profit  as a
percentage of sales) during the second half of the fiscal year than in the first
half.

                                          Q1 FY05          Q1 FY04
         Total Debt*                      $5,677           $6,114
         Less: Cash On Hand               $  370           $  722
                                          -------          --------
                           Total          $5,307           $5,392

13.      What were the gross margins and operating margins this quarter ($
         amounts in millions, rounded)?

         Gross Margin = Gross Profit* divided by Net Sales
         Gross Margin = $688/$3,496 = 19.7%

         Operating Margin = Segment Operating Profit** divided by Net Sales
         Operating Margin = $341/$3,496 = 9.7%

         * Gross Profit = Net Sales minus Costs of Goods Sold
         ($3,496 - $2,807 = $688)

         **See first quarter segment operating results for a reconciliation of
         operating profit to income from continuing operations. Income from
         continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of
         changes in accounting divided by Net Sales = $214/$3,496 = 6.1%.


14.      Why are accounts receivable higher than last year?

         Last year the company sold through securitization programs
         approximately $420 million of accounts receivable. With the company's
         strong cash position, the company has elected not to draw from its
         asset securitization program, and as a result, the accounts receivable
         balance is currently higher than it was last year.


15.      What was the trade working capital position at quarter end, excluding
         amounts for discontinued operations?

         Trade working capital is defined as the net position of Accounts

         Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Advances on Sales).

         Accounts Receivable*              $1,350            $  808

                  Net Position             $1,590            $  830

         * Please note question 14 regarding higher accounts receivable balance.


16.      What is the preliminary estimate of the effective tax rate for fiscal
         2005?

         Approximately 38%.


17.      What are projected Capital Expenditures for fiscal 2005?

         information systems and the logistics network.


18.      What is the expected net interest expense for fiscal 2005?

19.      The first quarter of fiscal 2005 reflected $0.02 per share of expense
         related to implementing cost savings initiatives. Does the company have
         any additional comments on the initiatives?

          o    The company expects $0.01 per share of additional  expense in the
               second  quarter  resulting  in a total of $0.03 per share for the
               full fiscal year of 2005.
          o    As part of efforts  to  improve  the  company's  cost  structure,
               margins,  and  competitive  position,  the  company is  currently
               implementing a series of  initiatives  that will better align and
               utilize the company's collective resources.
          o    The  initiatives  were  started in the  second  quarter of fiscal
               2004,  and have  continued  into fiscal 2005.  These  initiatives
               include:
               >>   Elimination of duplicative costs and overhead;
               >>   Consolidation of selected plants and support functions;
               >>   Efforts to streamline and improve our ability to do business
                    with our customers, distributors and brokers; and
               >>   Realignment of business organizations.
          o    These  initiatives  are  expected  to be more than offset by cost
               savings in the future.


20.      During the quarter, did the company receive any proceeds related to
         the previous divestitures?

         During the quarter, the company collected approximately $60 million of
         receivables related to the divestiture of United Agri Products; no gain
         or loss resulted from this collection.


21.      What does the company plan to do with the $300 million of 7.4%

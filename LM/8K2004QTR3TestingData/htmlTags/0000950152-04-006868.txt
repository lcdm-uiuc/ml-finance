Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

         On September 13, 2004, the Company issued the press release attached to
this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.01, referring to the filing of this Form 8-K and
describing certain disclosures made in Item 4.02(a) as well as providing
information regarding the delay in the filing of the Company's Form 10-K and
certain earnings guidance.


Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related
           Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.

     (a)

         As previously reported, in October 2003, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") initiated an informal inquiry regarding Cardinal Health,
Inc. (the "Company"). The SEC's request sought historical financial and related
information including but not limited to the accounting treatment of certain
recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. The SEC's request sought a variety of
documentation, including the Company's accounting records for fiscal 2001
through fiscal 2003, as well as notes, memoranda, presentations, e-mail and
other correspondence, budgets, forecasts and estimates. In connection with the
SEC's informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company commenced its own internal review in April 2004, assisted by independent
counsel, which review has been ongoing. On May 6, 2004, the Company was notified
that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal investigation. On
June 21, 2004, as part of the SEC's formal investigation, the Company received
an additional SEC subpoena that included a request for the production of
documents relating to revenue classification, and the methods used for such
classification, in the Company's Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either
"Operating Revenues" or "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other." In
addition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
of New York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the
Company understands relates to the revenue classification issue. The Company
continues to respond to the SEC's investigation and the Audit Committee's
internal review and provide all information required.

         In September 2004, the Audit Committee reached initial preliminary
conclusions with respect to findings to date from its internal review. These
preliminary conclusions regarding certain items that impact revenues and
earnings relate to three primary areas of focus: (1) classification of sales to
customer warehouses between "Operating Revenues" and "Bulk Deliveries to
Customer Warehouses and Other" within the Company's Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services segment; (2) disclosure of cash discounts earned from
suppliers for prompt payment; and (3) balance sheet reserve and accrual
adjustments. The Audit Committee review with respect to these and other matters
is continuing. In connection with these preliminary conclusions, the Audit
Committee determined on September 11, 2004, that the financial statements of the
Company with respect to fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 as well as the first three
quarters of fiscal 2004 should be restated to reflect the preliminary
conclusions from its internal review to date, and as such, that the financial
statements of the Company for such periods should no longer be relied upon. The
Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's independent accountants the
matters disclosed in this Form 8-K filing pursuant to this Item 4.02(a). Since
the Audit Committee's internal review is not complete, there can be no assurance
that the restatements described in this Form 8-K will not change upon completion
of the Audit Committee's internal review. In addition, as the Audit Committee's
internal review continues, new issues may surface that impact the Company's
financial statements and the scope of the restatements described in this Form
8-K. The impact of the restatements described below, as well as additional
restatements, if any, then determined to be appropriate, will be included in the
Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 when it is filed
with the SEC.

         The initial preliminary conclusions of the Audit Committee from its
internal review to date are as follows:

     1.   Revenue Impact: Classification of Sales To Customer Warehouses Between
          "Operating Revenues" and "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
          Other" Within the Company's Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider
          Services Segment

                  As presented historically, the Pharmaceutical Distribution and
         Provider Services segment's

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

         revenue was classified into two categories ("Operating Revenues" and
         "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other"). "Bulk Deliveries
         to Customer Warehouses and Other" have historically included revenues
         arising from sales where the Company ordered pharmaceutical product in
         bulk on behalf of a specific warehousing customer and either the
         manufacturer ships the product directly to the customer's warehouse or
         the product is shipped to the customer's warehouse shortly after it is
         received by the Company and is not put into the Company's inventory (in
         either case, "Bulk Revenues"). For all Bulk Revenues, the product is
         shipped to the customer in the same bulk containers in which it is
         received by the Company from the manufacturers. The Company previously
         followed an internal policy for distinguishing between Operating
         Revenues and Bulk Revenues based on how long the product was in the
         Company's possession prior to being shipped to customers. If the
         product was in the possession of the Company for more than 24 hours
         prior to being shipped to customers, then, regardless of other
         characteristics of the transaction or the reason for the product being
         held more than 24 hours, the sale of that product was deemed to be
         Operating Revenues. The Company's internal policy also provided that
         customer orders for bulk shipments filled from inventory within the
         Company's warehouse were deemed to be Operating Revenues if the order
         for the product had been placed with the manufacturer prior to the
         Company receiving the bulk order from its customer. Based on results of
         the internal review conducted by the Audit Committee, the Company has
         concluded that certain bulk shipments ordered by customers were
         intentionally held beyond 24 hours so that, pursuant to the internal
         policy, such shipments were classified as Operating Revenues in four
         quarters within fiscal 2003 and 2002. The impact of this practice was
         not previously quantified and disclosed as part of the Company's
         reported Operating Revenues. The improper classification between Bulk
         Revenues and Operating Revenues had no impact on the Company's total
         revenues or reported net earnings for these periods.

                  The following table shows the amount of Bulk Revenues that
         were improperly classified as "Operating Revenues" in the manner
         described above, and shows the impact from adjusting each of Bulk
         Revenues and  Operating Revenues for the periods in which these
         improper classifications occurred:

         statements of earnings.

     2.  Undisclosed Earnings Impact:  Disclosure of Cash Discounts Earned From
         Suppliers

                  Historically, the Company has recognized cash discounts as a
         reduction of cost of products sold primarily upon payment of vendor
         invoices. Cash discounts are the discounts the Company receives from
         some vendors for timely payment of invoices. The Company had a practice
         of accelerating payment of vendor invoices at the end of certain
         reporting periods in order to earn cash discounts, which had the effect
         of increasing operating results. Although the effect of these
         accelerated payments were included in the Company's reported earnings,
         the impact of this acceleration practice was not separately quantified
         and had not been previously disclosed in the periods in which the
         Company benefited from this practice. The net increase (decrease) in
         net earnings as a

                  Additional information on the accounting for cash discounts
         will be included in the Company's Form 10-K.

3.       Restated Earnings:  Balance Sheet Reserve and Accrual Adjustments

                  The Audit Committee's internal review included a review to
         determine if period-end adjustments to balance sheet reserve accounts
         and other accruals recorded in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 were properly
         recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
         ("GAAP"). Based upon the Audit Committee's internal review, the Company
         determined there were various situations where (a) amount of reserve,
         (b) timing of reserve recognition, or (c) timing of reserve adjustments
         could not be substantiated or was in error. As a result, the financial
         statements for certain prior fiscal quarters and years will be restated
         by the Company.

                  The balance sheet reserves and accrual adjustments to be
         restated consist of the following:

               1.   Errors arising from misapplication of GAAP. These errors
                    primarily include (a) reductions in reserve accounts made in
                    periods subsequent to the period in which the excess had
                    been identified by the Company, and (b) a LIFO inventory
                    adjustment.

               2.   Errors made in previous periods which were identified and
                    appropriately corrected in a subsequent period when
                    discovered. These items were not reported as prior period
                    corrections at the time of their discovery because they were
                    deemed immaterial. At this time, however, the Company plans
                    to restate its prior financial statements to correct for
                    such items identified during the internal review. This
                    category also includes an item related to merchandising
                    and buying margin that was determined in the fourth quarter
                    of fiscal 2004.

               3.   As a result of discussions with the SEC staff, the Company
                    has decided to reverse its previous recognition of estimated
                    recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for amounts
                    overcharged in prior years and to recognize the income from
                    such recoveries as a special item in the period cash was
                    received from the manufacturers. The Company recognized
                    $10.0 million of operating earnings ($6.5 million net of
                    taxes) in the second quarter of fiscal 2001 and $12.0
                    million of operating earnings ($7.9 million net of taxes) in
                    the first quarter of fiscal 2002 based on its estimate of
                    amounts that would subsequently be received. The initial
                    actual cash payments received from manufacturers of $35.3
                    million ($21.5 million net of taxes) in the fourth quarter
                    of fiscal 2002 exceeded the $22.0 million ($13.4 million net
                    of taxes) previously accrued. The SEC staff has

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

                    previously advised the Company that, in its view, the
                    Company did not have an appropriate basis for recognizing
                    the income in advance of receiving the cash.

                  The following table summarizes the restatement impact on
         previously reported net earnings as defined above for fiscal 2004, 2003
         and 2002:

         The SEC investigation, the Audit Committee's internal review and the
U.S. Attorney inquiry remain ongoing. While the information in this Form 8-K
describes all of the items for which the Audit Committee has determined a
restatement is appropriate at this time, there can be no assurance that the
ongoing investigation, review and inquiry will not identify any additional
items. In addition, as the Audit Committee's internal review continues, new
issues may surface that impact the Company's financial statements and the scope
of the restatement described in this Form 8-K. The impact of the restatements
described above, as well as additional restatements, if any, then determined to
be appropriate, will be included in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2004 when it is filed with the SEC. While the Company is
continuing in its efforts to respond to the SEC's investigation and the Audit
Committee's internal review and provide all information required, the Company
cannot predict their outcome. The outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S.
Attorney inquiry and any related legal and administrative proceedings could
include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal
proceedings as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and
sanctions.

             CARDINAL HEALTH DELAYS FILING FISCAL YEAR-END RESULTS,
                   FORM 8-K DISCLOSES ANTICIPATED RESTATEMENT

     GUIDANCE REAFFIRMED FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004, UPDATED FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005


DUBLIN, OHIO, SEPT. 13, 2004--Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE: CAH) today submitted
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that provides the
company with a 15-day extension to timely file its Form 10-K for fiscal year
2004, which ended June 30.

The company also filed a Form 8-K with the SEC that provides information
regarding the effect on the company's financial statements from an anticipated
restatement. The information regarding the anticipated restatement was provided
as a result of preliminary conclusions from an ongoing internal review by the
Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. Since the Audit Committee's
conclusions are preliminary, there can be no assurance that the anticipated
restatements will not change upon completion of the Audit Committee's internal
review. (These initial conclusions are included in the Form 8-K, which can be
found at the investor relations page of www.cardinal.com).


The anticipated restatements are not expected to change the guidance Cardinal
Health provided on June 30 for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004.

In addition, Cardinal Health updated its guidance for fiscal year 2005. Based on
current business conditions, the company expects earnings per share to decline
by 10 percent to 15 percent for the first half of the fiscal year, with a
decline of approximately 25 percent in the first quarter. This decline primarily
reflects the ongoing business model transition in Cardinal Health's
pharmaceutical distribution segment. Margin pressures in this business are
expected to continue as pharmaceutical price increases slow from historic levels
and Cardinal Health transitions to a new fee-based compensation model for the
distribution services it provides pharmaceutical manufacturers. Margin pressure
on medical products and delays in the start-up and associated costs of new
sterile manufacturing projects are also expected to contribute to the first-half
earnings decline.

ANTICIPATED RESTATEMENT
PAGE 2

Cardinal Health has initiated strategic and operational actions to improve
long-term results, including a restructuring program targeting cost structure
improvements of $125 million in fiscal year 2005, with greater annual savings
over a three-year period. Cardinal Health maintains an earnings-per-share growth
goal of at least 10 percent for fiscal year 2005. Achievement of this goal,
however, is dependent on operational progress and improvements, most notably in
its pharmaceutical distribution business.

As previously reported, in October 2003, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry
regarding Cardinal Health seeking historical financial and related information.
In May, the company was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry
into a formal investigation. In June, as part of the SEC's formal investigation,
Cardinal Health received an SEC subpoena that included a request for the
production of documents relating to revenue classification, and the methods used
for such classification, in the company's Pharmaceutical Distribution business
as either "Operating Revenues" or "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
Other." In addition, the company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of New York had also commenced an inquiry that the company understands
relates to the revenue classification issue. Cardinal Health continues to
respond to the investigations by providing all information required.

An investor meeting scheduled for Sept. 15 has been postponed. The company plans
to reschedule the meeting on a date following the filing of its Form 10-K.

    Morgan Stanley Reports $837 Million In Third Quarter Earnings

    NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 22, 2004--Morgan Stanley (NYSE:
MWD) today reported net income of $837 million for the quarter ended
August 31, 2004 -- a decrease of $432 million, or 34 percent, from the
third quarter of 2003 and $386 million, or 32 percent, from the second
quarter of 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $0.76 compared with
$1.15 a year ago and $1.10 in the second quarter. The annualized
return on average common equity was 12.3 percent in the current
quarter, as compared with 22.0 percent in the third quarter of 2003
and 18.4 percent in the second quarter of 2004.
    Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the
provision for loan losses) of $5.4 billion were 3 percent higher than
last year's third quarter but 18 percent below this year's second
quarter. Non-interest expenses of $4.1 billion were 23 percent higher
than a year ago, but 15 percent below last quarter. In the third
quarter of 2003, the year-to-date effect of changes to the terms of
the Company's equity-based compensation program reduced compensation
expense by $519 million and increased net income by $350 million,
diluted earnings per share by $0.32 and the annualized return on
average common equity by 6.1 percentage points.

    Business Highlights

    - For the first eight months of calendar 2004, the Company ranked
        first in global equity and equity-linked issuances, first in
        global IPOs, and second in both global debt issuances and
        global completed M&A.

    - Firmwide assets under management reached $510 billion at quarter
        end, an 18 percent increase from a year ago.1

    - Credit quality at Discover Card continued to improve, with net
        charge-off and delinquency rates at their lowest levels in
        more than three years. Pre-tax earnings were $330 million --
        up 13 percent from a year ago and Discover Card's second best
        quarter in four years.

    Philip J. Purcell, chairman and CEO, said, "Our firm continued to
generate significant momentum with clients. In investment banking, we
completed several landmark deals. Our Investment Management business
and Discover Card also performed well, but reduced trading revenues
resulted in lower quarterly earnings for the firm."
    The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $42 million in the current
quarter related to the markdown of certain aircraft that are subject
to a probable sale and, accordingly, have been designated as "held for
sale". The revenues and expenses associated with these aircraft have
been classified as "discontinued operations" for all periods
presented.
    For the first nine months of 2004, net income was $3,286 million,
an 18 percent increase over $2,773 million a year ago. Diluted
earnings per share were $2.97, up 18 percent from a year ago. Net
revenues rose 16 percent to $18.3 billion and non-interest expenses
increased 16 percent to $13.3 billion. The annualized return on
average common equity for the nine-month period was 16.6 percent
compared with 16.3 percent last year.

    INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES

    Institutional Securities posted pre-tax income2 of $682 million,
down 43 percent from the third quarter of 2003 -- largely driven by
higher non-interest expenses, which included the impact of last year's
compensation program changes. Net revenues of $2.8 billion were 1
percent lower, reflecting a decline in fixed income sales and trading
revenues, largely offset by improved results in advisory and
underwriting activities, and higher equity sales and trading revenues.

    - Fixed income sales and trading net revenues were $1.2 billion,
        down 19 percent from the third quarter of 2003. Revenues
        declined sharply in interest rate & currency products. Mixed
        U.S. economic data coupled with higher global energy prices
        led to concerns about the strength of economic growth, and
        resulted in a more difficult trading environment. Commodities
        had another strong quarter, although slightly lower than last
        year, as tight oil supplies, concerns about production
        disruptions and growing demand drove energy prices and
        volatilities higher. Credit products revenues were modestly
        lower this quarter.

    - Equity sales and trading net revenues increased 6 percent from
        last year to $883 million. The increase was driven primarily
        by higher revenues from the Company's Prime Brokerage and cash
        businesses. This quarter's revenues were impacted by
        continuing low levels of market volatility, which reduced
        trading opportunities.

    - The Company's aggregate average trading VaR was $79 million in
        the current quarter compared with $54 million in the third
        quarter of last year, and $72 million in the second quarter of
        2004.

    - Advisory revenues were $310 million, a 138 percent increase from
        last year's third quarter. There was a significant increase in
        the Company's market share in completed M&A transactions and a
        62 percent increase in industry-wide completed M&A activity
        over the same period.3

    - Underwriting revenues were $401 million, up 3 percent from last
        year's third quarter. Equity underwriting revenues rose 9
        percent. While industry-wide equity underwriting activity fell
        12 percent compared to last year, the Company's volume of
        activity increased 12 percent over the same period. The
        Company's equity global market share rose from 7 percent a
        year ago to 9 percent in the current quarter. Fixed income
        underwriting revenues declined 2 percent from a year ago,
        compared with a 1 percent increase in industry-wide activity.
        The Company's fixed income global market share remained at 8
        percent.3

    - For the calendar year-to-date, the Company ranked first in
        global equity and equity-linked issuances with a 12 percent
        market share, first in global IPOs with a 15 percent market
        share, second in global debt issuances with a 7 percent market
        share, second in completed global M&A with a 32 percent market
        share and fourth in announced global M&A with a 24 percent
        market share.4 Landmark transactions completed during the
        quarter included the $1.9 billion Google IPO, the $3.1 billion
        Deutsche PostBank IPO and the defense of Aventis resulting in
        its $65.7 billion sale to Sanofi-Synthelabo S.A. Significant
        M&A transactions announced during the quarter included
        National Grid Transco's $10.7 billion asset sale and the $1.4
        billion sale of Marks & Spencer Money to HSBC.

    - Non-interest expenses for the quarter rose 32 percent to $2.1
        billion. Compensation expense increased because last year's
        third quarter included the year-to-date impact of changes in
        the Company's equity-based compensation program. In addition,
        higher levels of business activity resulted in increases in
        the professional services and other expense categories.
        Expected costs related to legal and regulatory matters
        increased to approximately $50 million, driven by a failure to
        deliver certain prospectuses pursuant to regulatory
        requirements.

    INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR GROUP

    The Individual Investor Group posted pre-tax income of $22
million, an 88 percent decline from last year's third quarter. The
decline in earnings resulted from higher non-interest expenses,
partially offset by a modest increase in net revenues.

    - Total net revenues rose 2 percent from a year ago to $1.1
        billion, driven by a 28 percent increase in asset management,
        distribution and administration fees, reflecting higher client
        asset levels in fee-based accounts. This increase was largely
        offset by declines of 12 percent in commissions and 25 percent
        in principal transaction trading revenues resulting from lower
        sales of fixed income products.

    - Non-interest expenses increased 21 percent from a year ago to
        $1.1 billion. Compensation expense was higher because last
        year's third quarter included the year-to-date impact of
        changes in the Company's equity-based compensation program.
        Also, legal and regulatory expenses increased approximately
        $70 million, of which the largest driver was expected costs
        associated with a failure to deliver certain prospectuses
        pursuant to regulatory requirements.

    - Total client assets were $576 billion, a 6 percent increase from
        last year's third quarter and a decrease of 1 percent from
        this year's second quarter. Client assets in fee-based
        accounts rose 20 percent to $146 billion over the past twelve
        months and increased as a percentage of total client assets to
        25 percent from 22 percent over the same period.

    - At quarter-end, the number of global financial advisors was
        10,785 -- 541 lower than a year ago but an increase of 63 over
        the quarter.

    INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

    Investment Management pre-tax income rose 33 percent from last
year's third quarter to $217 million. Net revenues increased 16
percent to $692 million, driven by higher investment gains and an
increase in average assets under management. Non-interest expenses
rose 9 percent to $475 million on higher compensation expenses
reflecting the increase in net revenues, as well as the impact of last
year's compensation program change.

    - Assets under management within Investment Management were $394
        billion, $49 billion above the third quarter of last year. The
        increase resulted from both market appreciation and positive
        net flows.

    - Institutional assets were $200 billion, an increase of $45
        billion from a year ago. The increase in institutional assets
        reflected market appreciation and the continuation of robust
        growth in liquidity products. Retail assets of $194 billion
        were $4 billion higher than a year ago.

    - Among full-service brokerage firms, the Company had the highest
        number of domestic funds (37) receiving one of Morningstar's
        two highest ratings.5 In addition, the percent of the
        Company's fund assets performing in the top half of the Lipper
        rankings was 60 percent over one year, 70 percent over three
        years and 76 percent over five years.6

    - Investment gains for the quarter were $90 million, up from $10
        million a year ago and included approximately $75 million
        associated with an ownership interest in Vanguard Health
        Systems.

    CREDIT SERVICES

    Credit Services posted pre-tax income of $330 million on a managed
basis, up 13 percent from last year's third quarter. The increase was
driven by a lower provision for loan losses, reflecting improved
credit quality, partially offset by a decline in net interest income,
lower merchant and cardmember fees and higher non-interest expenses
driven by an increase in marketing expenses.

    - Managed credit card loans of $47.1 billion at quarter end were 6
        percent lower than a year ago although slightly above the
        level at the beginning of the quarter. Net interest income
        fell $100 million from a year ago, reflecting the decline in
        credit card loan balances and a narrower interest rate spread,
        which contracted eight basis points to 8.83 percent, as a
        lower yield more than offset lower cost of funds.

    - Managed merchant and cardmember fees were $499 million, down 5
        percent from a year ago, primarily due to lower late and
        overlimit fees. The decline in these fees reflected sharply
        lower credit card delinquencies.

    - Transaction volume increased 2 percent to $25.4 billion, the
        second highest quarterly volume ever.

    - The managed credit card net charge-off rate for the third
        quarter was 5.76 percent, 114 basis points below a year ago --
        and its lowest level in more than three years. The decrease
        reflects the effect of the Company's credit and collection
        initiatives and an industry-wide improvement in credit
        quality, including the stabilization of bankruptcy filings.

    - The managed credit card over-30-day delinquency rate was 4.81
        percent, a decrease of 124 basis points from the third quarter
        of 2003. The managed credit card over-90-day delinquency rate
        was 2.22 percent, 69 basis points lower than a year ago.

    - Non-interest expenses of $567 million rose 5 percent from a year
        ago, primarily due to increased marketing expenses, largely
        related to account acquisition activity and merchant
        initiatives.

    As of August 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased approximately 9
million shares of its common stock since the end of fiscal 2003. The
Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.25
quarterly dividend per common share. The dividend is payable on
October 29, 2004, to common shareholders of record on October 8, 2004.
    Total capital at August 31, 2004 was $101.2 billion, including
$30.3 billion of common shareholders' equity and junior subordinated
debt issued to capital trusts. Book value per common share was $25.00,
based on 1.1 billion shares outstanding.

    OTHER MATTERS

    The Company also announced that it has reached an agreement in
principle with the Staff of the New York Stock Exchange relating to
its failure to comply with certain prospectus delivery requirements,
operational deficiencies, employee defalcations (including the Soto
matter) and other matters. The settlement will include a fine of $19
million. Negotiations with the Staff about the details of the
resolution have not concluded, and no assurance can be given that a
resolution will be achieved.

(2) At May 31, 2004 and August 31, 2004, shareholders' equity
    includes $2,897 million of junior subordinated debt issued
    to capital trusts that in prior periods was classified as
    preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption.  This
    amount was reclassified to long-term debt at February 29, 2004
    pursuant to the adoption of FIN 46.  See Note 12 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Form 10-K
    for fiscal 2003.  At the prior quarter ends, shareholders'
    equity included preferred securities subject to mandatory
    redemption.  The junior subordinated debt issued to capital
    trusts and the preferred securities subject to mandatory
    redemption at quarter ends prior to February 29, 2004
    are collectively referred to hereinafter as junior
    subordinated debt issued to capital trusts.
(3) Includes common equity, junior subordinated debt issued to
    capital trusts, capital units and the non-current portion
    of long-term debt.
(4) 99%/One-Day VaR represents the loss amount that one would not
    expect to exceed, on average, more than one time every one hundred
    trading days in the Company's trading positions if the
    portfolio were held constant for a one day period.
    The Company's VaR incorporates substantially all financial
    instruments generating market risk that are managed by the
    Company's trading businesses.  For a further discussion of the
    calculation of VaR and the limitations of the Company's
    VaR methodology, see Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative

The following pages (F-16 - F-18) present a reconciliation for certain
information disclosed on pages F-7, F-13 and F-15.


The data is presented on both a "managed" loan basis and as reported
under generally accepted accounting principles ("owned" loan basis).
Managed loan data assume that the Company's securitized loan
receivables have not been sold and presents the results of securitized
loan receivables in the same manner as the Company's owned loans.
The Company operates its Credit Services business and analyzes its
financial performance on a managed basis.  Accordingly, underwriting
and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized
loans.  The Company believes that managed loan information is useful
to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of
loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed
portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks
inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations.
In addition, investors often request information on a managed basis,
which provides a more meaningful comparison to industry competitors.

The following page (F-19) presents a reconciliation of adjusted
assets.


Balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy
when viewed in the context of a company's overall liquidity and
capital policies.  The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as
a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial
services firms and evaluating leverage trends.  Adjusted assets
exclude certain self-funded assets considered to have minimal market,
credit and/or liquidity risk that are generally attributable to
matched book and securities lending businesses as measured by
aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non-
derivative short positions.  In addition, the adjusted leverage
ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders' equity of the amount
of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets, as the
Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support
its risk capital needs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)   The Company views the junior subordinated debt issued to capital
      trusts as a component of its equity capital base given the
      inherent characteristics of the securities.  These
      characteristics include the long dated nature (final maturity
      at issuance of thirty years extendable at the Company's option
      by a further nineteen years), the Company's ability to defer
      coupon interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters, and the
      subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure.
      The Company also receives rating agency equity credit for these
      securities.
(2)   Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible
      shareholders' equity.
(3)   Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted total assets divided
      by tangible shareholders' equity.
Note: Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period

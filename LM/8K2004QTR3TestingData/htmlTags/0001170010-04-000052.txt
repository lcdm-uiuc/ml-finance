Second Quarter Business Performance Review
- ------------------------------------------

Sales. "Our used car business continued to experience widespread sales
- ------
volatility and softness throughout the quarter," said Austin Ligon, president
and chief executive officer. "We believe these effects are occurring broadly
across the late model used car market. We also believe current economic factors,
such as higher gas prices, have contributed to the market environment. Newer
model used cars also appear to be affected by the unusually intense and volatile
incentive competition among new car manufacturers - particularly the domestic
manufacturers. The sales softness in the second quarter was exacerbated by the
severe weather experienced in Florida and the southeastern United States in
August. Despite the sales softness, our best information indicates that we are
maintaining or gaining used car market share.

"We posted strong new car comp sales increases, reflecting the strength of the
principal brands we represent - DaimlerChrysler, Nissan, and Toyota," Ligon
continued. "Total new car sales declined modestly, as the comp sales increases
were more than offset by the impact of having disposed of four new car
franchises since last year's first quarter." In accordance with our plan to
divest non-strategic new car franchises, during the second quarter CarMax
returned the rights to its Laurel Mitsubishi franchise to the manufacturer.

"Wholesale sales continued to benefit from the steps we've taken to improve our
`buy rate,' or the ratio of appraisal purchases completed to appraisal offers
made, and from higher wholesale prices," said Ligon. "Similar to the first
quarter, enhanced systems support and a new, more consistent appraisal delivery
process contributed to a year-over-year increase in our buy rate.

"Other sales and revenues increased approximately 3%, as growth in our service
revenue was partially offset by a decrease in third-party finance fees," Ligon
said. "In August, we rolled out Drive Financial Services, a new third-party
finance provider focused on subprime customers. As is customary in the subprime
finance industry, Drive purchases the loan contracts at a discount.

This discount is reflected in our income statement as an offset to the fees
received from third-party providers lending to prime and nonprime customers."

Margins. "Used car gross profit dollars per unit declined modestly compared with
- --------
the second quarter of last year, reflecting the impact of the slower overall
used car sales pace," said Ligon. "We adjust vehicle prices based on our
proprietary inventory pricing model in order to maintain high inventory turns.
However, during the first two months of the quarter, we maintained inventories
at lower than original plan but higher than current sales rates. We did this in
order to be able to take advantage of an upturn in sales during the peak sales
months of the summer, if that were to occur. This reduced our turns and
pressured gross margin. However, in August we reduced our inventory levels, as
is our practice. We target having our lowest inventory position of the year
during the week following Labor Day, in order to minimize the inherent inventory
risk associated with the new car model year changeover in the fall. Despite the
soft used car sales trends, we were successful in reducing inventories to target
levels at August 31."

The lower margin on other sales and revenues resulted primarily from lower
service margin and the inclusion of the Drive discount in third-party finance
fee revenue.

CarMax Auto Finance. "As expected, CAF income was lower than last year," said
- --------------------
Ligon. "The CAF gain as a percent of loans sold was 3.9% in this year's second
quarter, which is in line with our expectations for a normalized gain spread,
compared with 4.8% in last year's second quarter. The decline in the gain spread
reflects the change in the underlying interest rate environment, with funding
costs having risen faster than consumer rates. For the balance of the year, we
expect that CAF gain spreads will be at the lower end of the 3.5% to 4.5%
normalized range."

SG&A Ratio. "Our second quarter SG&A ratio increased to 10.2% in this year's
- -----------
second quarter compared with a 9.8% ratio in last year's second quarter," said
Ligon. "The higher ratio resulted from the deleveraging associated with negative
used unit comps."

Third Quarter Expectations
- --------------------------

  o      Comparable store used unit performance: A range of -8% to -2%.

  o      Earnings per share: A range of 12 cents to 17 cents.

"The third quarter, which coincides with the new car model year changeover
period, is typically both our lowest volume period seasonally and our most
difficult quarter to predict," said Ligon. "The continuing sales volatility and
weakness combined with the normally challenging model year changeover period
makes forecasting especially difficult. This year's hurricane season isn't
helping. While we are encouraged by our sales in the beginning of September -
excluding the weather-affected Southeast markets - our estimates for the quarter
assume that market conditions remain volatile."

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

H. J. Heinz Company wishes to disclose its press release dated August 24, 2004
furnished herewith as Exhibit 99*, which presents the financial results of the
Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that
impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These
special items include, in Fiscal Year 2004, the impact of reorganization costs
and the gain on the sale of the company's bakery business in Northern Europe.
Operating segment income excluding these special items is not a measure that is
defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), but it is used by
management to assist in evaluating the Registrant's results of operations from
period to period. Management believes this information also may be useful to the
readers of the financial statements in evaluating the Registrant's operating
results between fiscal periods and provides additional clarity in understanding
the trends of the business. Also disclosed on Exhibit 99* is supplemental
information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in
connection with the financial results for the first quarters of Fiscal Years
2004 and 2005.

  World Headquarters
"THE GOOD FOOD COMPANY"

             HEINZ REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS IN LINE WITH SALES,
                    CASH & EARNINGS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2005

     o    EPS OF 55 CENTS VS. 60 CENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH INCLUDED
          DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SPECIAL ITEMS

     o    EPS OF 55 CENTS UP 7.8% OVER PRIOR-YEAR EPS FROM CONTINUING
          OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS

     o    SALES INCREASE 5.7%, WITH VOLUME UP 1.9% REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN
          NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND EUROPE

     o    CASH CONVERSION CYCLE REDUCED 12 DAYS VERSUS PRIOR YEAR

PITTSBURGH - August 24, 2004 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today reported net
income of $194.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the Fiscal 2005 first
quarter ended July 28, 2004. This compares to $214.0 million, or $0.60 per
share, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, which included profit associated
with business units spun off to Del Monte Foods along with special items.
Excluding discontinued operations and special items, Heinz's first quarter EPS
in Fiscal 2005 increased 7.8% over earnings of $179.8 million, or $0.51 per
diluted share for the prior-year period.

     Commenting on the Company's performance, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman,
President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Heinz is off to a strong start in
Fiscal 2005, with first quarter results consistent with our full-year outlook.
Innovation continues to drive profitable growth in our top brands, most notably
Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes, which had excellent results behind the launch of our
exciting new Extra Crispy(TM) and Easy Fries(TM) lines. This, combined with
restaging and repricing initiatives around the world, helped generate strong
first quarter sales and volume growth against our full-year objective of net
sales growth of 2-3%. At the same time, we continued to remove clutter and
squeeze out cost to improve our cash management and balance sheet performance,
with reduced working capital and a 12-day improvement in the Cash Conversion
Cycle. Overall, our first quarter performance is in line with our full-year
target ranges of EPS of $2.32 - $2.42 and Operating Free Cash Flow of $800
million - $1 billion."

     Heinz's positive earnings performance reflected strong first quarter sales
growth of 5.7% due to a combination of favorable foreign exchange rates and a
1.9% increase in volume/mix. The volume/mix improvement was driven mainly by
very strong volume growth of 6.7% in the North American Consumer Products
business, primarily in frozen brands such as Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes.
Europe's volume increased 2.1%, reflecting strong volume growth in the U.K. and
Italy. The Company also noted robust sales growth of 7.8% for its top 15 power
brands. These volume increases were partially offset by a 1.0% drop in net
pricing related to the Company's product restage in Italy and market pressure in
the Netherlands and New Zealand.


<PAGE>

                                       2

     The Company's balance sheet and working capital management showed continued
improvement over the Fiscal 2004 first quarter. Operating Free Cash Flow (cash
from operations less capital expenditures) was $148 million in the quarter, the
Cash Conversion Cycle improved 12 days, and net debt (total debt less cash and
cash equivalents and the value of interest rate swaps) was reduced by $320
million versus the prior-year period.

(Comments on the first quarter that follow refer to the results from continuing
operations, excluding special items, in Fiscal 2004. See attached tables for
further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.
Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity
in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a
view of the business excluding special items.)


     Heinz's Gross Profit Margin was 36.9% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6
percentage points over the year-ago period. The decrease in the Gross Profit
Margin was due mainly to increased trade promotion spending and higher commodity
costs. Operating income increased 3.0%, primarily due to the favorable sales
increase, partially offset by the reduced Gross Profit Margin and increases in
SG&A. The higher SG&A cost largely reflects fuel cost inflation and the switch
from stock options to performance-based pay, partially offset by reduced
consumer marketing. Income from continuing operations grew 8.4%, mainly
reflecting higher operating results, reduced interest expense and a lower
effective tax rate.


HIGHLIGHTS

NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS

     Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 8.4%.
Volume increased sales 6.7%, due to significant growth in Ore-Ida(R) frozen
potatoes behind the successful launch of the innovative Extra Crispy(TM) and
microwaveable Easy Fries(TM) lines and the extension of the Smart Ones(R) Truth
About Carbs(TM) line. Volume also grew in Delimex(R) and TGI Friday's(R) frozen
snacks and appetizers. Acquisitions increased sales 2.6%, due to the prior-year
purchase of the Canadian operations of Unifine Richardson B.V., which
manufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces, and dessert toppings. The
divestiture of Ethnic Gourmet Foods(R) and Rosetto(R) pasta during the quarter
reduced sales 1.1%.

     Aided by the popularity of its innovative Easy Squeeze!(TM) upside-down
bottle and expanded distribution of its One Carb ketchup, Heinz(R) Ketchup's
U.S. market share remained strong, exceeding 60%. Heinz(R) Homestyle Gravy also
recorded volume and market share growth, reflecting the positive impact of the
Company's EDLP initiatives for these brands.

     Operating income increased 3.1%, driven by the increase in volume and lower
consumer marketing, partially offset by higher commodity and fuel costs.

HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE

     Heinz's U.S. Foodservice business increased sales 3.8%. Acquisitions
increased sales 2.4% due to the prior year purchase of Truesoups LLC, a
manufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Higher pricing drove sales up
2.2% chiefly due to increases on Heinz(R) Ketchup

<PAGE>

                                       3


and single serve condiments, Chef Francisco(R) frozen soups, and Dianne's(R) and
Alden Merrell(R) frozen desserts. Sales volume decreased 0.7%, primarily due to
customer service issues at Portion Pac Inc. resulting from the startup of a new
warehouse management system that temporarily impacted shipments of some portion
control products early in the quarter.

     Operating income increased 5.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing, sales
mix and the Truesoups acquisition, partially offset by higher commodity and
distribution costs.


EUROPE

     Heinz Europe's sales increased 7.3%. Favorable exchange translation rates
boosted sales by 8.4%, with volume increasing 2.1% due primarily to strong
performance in the U.K. and Italy. Key growth initiatives included the
successful expansion of Heinz(R) Ketchup's new Top Down(TM) bottle, the relaunch
of the Plasmon(R) baby food line in Italy, growth in Heinz(R) ready-to-serve
soups, introduction of new Weight Watchers(R) frozen products and expanded
retail distribution of frozen desserts in the U.K. Heinz(R) Ketchup hit a new
market share record in the U.K. (78%), with Heinz(R) Salad Cream's share
surpassing 79%. Heinz(R) Ketchup's market share exceeded 31% in France and
reached new record highs in Germany, Spain and Switzerland. Lower pricing
decreased sales 2.2%, primarily due to increased trade promotion spending
related to the restage of the Italian infant feeding business and pricing
pressures in Northern Europe. Divestitures lowered sales by 1% as the company
continued to improve the focus of its European business.

     Operating income increased 5.2%, mainly due to strong sales volume and
favorable currency exchange translation rates. These benefits were partially
offset by increased trade promotional spending to improve price competitiveness
in Italy and The Netherlands together with unfavorable raw material and
production costs for the European seafood business.


ASIA PACIFIC

     Sales in Asia Pacific increased 1.5%. Favorable exchange translation rates
increased sales by 4.2%. Volumes decreased sales by 1.0% as volume increases in
New Zealand and Indonesia were more than offset by declines, primarily in Japan.
Lower pricing decreased sales 1.7% as Tegel(R) poultry responded to continuing
market pressures in New Zealand.

     Creative marketing and innovation helped drive growth in Heinz(R) soups and
beans in Australia, offset by declines in baby food and frozen vegetables.
Wattie's(R) in New Zealand also grew sales in soups, beans and spaghetti meals
through innovative recipes and strong trade support. Operating income decreased
5.8%, primarily due to reduced pricing in New Zealand.

        * The adoption of SFAS No. 150 by the Company in the second quarter of
        Fiscal 2004 required the prospective classification of Heinz Finance
        Company's $325 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred shares from
        minority interest to long-term debt. The prior period calculation of net
        debt includes the effects of this reclassification in order to provide
        more meaningful comparisons with the current period.

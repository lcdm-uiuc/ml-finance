                    DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS FIRST QUARTER
                   DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 44 CENTS

ORLANDO,  FL,  September 22 - Darden  Restaurants,  Inc. today reported sales of
$1.28 billion for the first quarter ended August 29, 2004, and quarterly diluted
net earnings per share of 44 cents, up 10% from prior year.

"We are pleased with this quarter's  improved  results," said Joe Lee,  Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Darden Restaurants.  "Despite the adverse effects
of Hurricane Charley and the Summer Olympics, we achieved solid earnings growth.
Olive Garden continues to perform well, Red Lobster and Bahama Breeze are making
progress in important areas and Smokey Bones continues its successful expansion.
We're  focused on sustained  brilliance  with the basics.  That means  providing
outstanding  service,  great tasting food and a clean,  comfortable and inviting
atmosphere  in  our  restaurants.   We  know  operating  excellence  and  strong
leadership teams are what it takes to be the best in casual dining."

Highlights for the quarter ended August 29, 2004, include the following:

o    Net  earnings  in the first  quarter  were $72.1  million,  or 44 cents per
     diluted  share,  on sales of $1.28  billion.  Last year,  net earnings were
     $68.6 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.26 billion.

o    Total sales of $1.28 billion represent a 1.5% increase over prior year.

o    Olive Garden reported its 40th consecutive quarter of U.S.  same-restaurant
     sales growth with a 2.8% increase.

o    On August 11, the Company  announced  that Clarence Otis, Jr. would succeed
     Joe Lee as Darden's  CEO in December  2004.  Lee will remain as Chairman of
     the Board  until his planned  retirement  in  December  2005,  when Otis is
     expected to become Chairman.

o    The Company also announced that Drew Madsen, now President of Olive Garden,
     will become  Darden's  President  and Chief  Operating  Officer in December
     2004.

                                       -2-

o    The Company continued its share repurchases, buying back 2.9 million shares
     of its common stock in the quarter.

Operating Highlights

OLIVE GARDEN'S first quarter sales of $580.5 million were 6.0% above prior year,
driven by revenue from 18 net new restaurants in operation  versus last year and
a U.S.  same-restaurant  sales  increase of 2.8%.  This is the 40th  consecutive
quarter of  same-restaurant  sales  growth for Olive Garden and builds on a 3.9%
increase  in the first  quarter of last year.  The  company's  increased  sales,
combined with lower restaurant expenses and selling,  general and administrative
expenses as a  percentage  of sales,  more than offset  increased  labor  costs,
resulting  in  a  record   quarterly   profit  that  also  represents  a  strong
double-digit operating profit increase over last year.

"This was a strong  quarter for Olive  Garden,"  said Drew Madsen,  President of
Olive Garden. "Our financial results in the areas of operating profit and return
on sales were outstanding.  We've delivered 10 straight years of same-restaurant
sales growth, and our goal is to deliver that kind of sustained  excellence well
into the  future.  To  accomplish  that,  our teams  will  continue  to focus on
delighting our guests with a genuine Italian dining experience."

RED LOBSTER'S  first quarter sales of $594.8 million were 6.2% below prior year,
reflecting  a U.S.  same-restaurant  sales  decrease of 7.6% that was  partially
offset by revenue  from an  additional  five net new  restaurants  in  operation
versus last year.  Profit margins per guest improved,  as this year's lower food
and beverage costs and  restaurant  expenses more than offset higher labor costs
and  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  as a  percent  of  sales.
Operating profits were slightly lower than last year, as expected.

"Red  Lobster's new `Simply Great'  operational  discipline is having a positive
impact," said Kim Lopdrup,  President of Red Lobster.  "We achieved record guest
satisfaction scores during the quarter. We also earned higher profit margins per
guest because of greater  efficiencies and reduced waste.  While we have a great
deal more work to do,  we are  pleased  that the  operating  performance  of our
restaurants  is  improving  rapidly.  I am also  delighted  with how quickly our
senior leaders have become an effective team."

BAHAMA  BREEZE  continued  to deliver  strong sales  improvement,  driven by the
addition  of the  lunch  daypart  in most of the  restaurants  and in  spite  of
operating two fewer restaurants than in the first quarter of the prior year.

SMOKEY BONES operated 32 more restaurants  than the prior year,  including seven
restaurants that were opened during the first quarter. For the full fiscal year,
30 to 40 new restaurants are expected to open.

Other Actions

Darden continued the buyback of its common stock,  purchasing 2.9 million shares
in the first quarter.  Since commencing its share  repurchases in December 1995,
the Company has repurchased a total of 112.2 million shares under authorizations
totaling 115.4 million shares.

August 2004 U.S. Same-Restaurant Sales Results

Darden  reported  same-restaurant  sales for the  four-week  fiscal August ended
August 29,  2004.  This period is the last month of  Darden's  fiscal 2005 first
quarter.

Same-restaurant  sales at Olive  Garden were down 2% to 3% for fiscal  August as
expected,  impacted by the company's  decision not to advertise during the final
two weeks of the month  during the  Olympics.  The decline  reflected a 5% to 6%
decrease in guest  counts and a 2% to 3% increase  in check  average.  The check
average  increase  was a result of a 2% to 3% increase in pricing and a 0% to 1%
increase from menu mix changes.  Last year,  Olive Garden had an  approximate 6%
increase in  same-restaurant  sales during fiscal August.  The company estimates
that the 2004 Summer Olympics in August and the decision not to advertise during
the  final  two  weeks  of  fiscal  August  adversely  affected  Olive  Garden's
same-restaurant sales by approximately 2% to 3%.

Heavily  affected  by a shift in  promotional  strategy  compared  to last year,
same-restaurant  sales at Red  Lobster  were down  approximately  16% for fiscal
August.  This  reflected  a 14% to 15%  decline  in guest  counts and a 1% to 2%
decline  in  check  average.   The  check  average  decrease  was  a  result  of
approximately  a 0% to 1% increase  in pricing and a 1% to 2% decline  from menu
mix   changes.   Last  year,   Red  Lobster  had  an  11%  to  12%  increase  in
same-restaurant sales during fiscal August.

The Company estimates that Hurricane  Charley,  which occurred in fiscal August,
adversely affected August  same-restaurant sales results at both Red Lobster and
Olive Garden by approximately 0.5% for a total sales impact at Darden of $1.5 to
$2.0 million.

Darden Restaurants,  Inc.,  headquartered in Orlando, FL, owns and operates over
1,300 Red Lobster,  Olive  Garden,  Bahama  Breeze,  Smokey Bones and Seasons 52
restaurants with annual sales of $5.0 billion.

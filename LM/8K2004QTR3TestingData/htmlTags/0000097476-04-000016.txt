- -    TI's ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a
     rapidly changing technological environment;

- -    TI's ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive
     industry;

     portfolio and obtain needed licenses from third parties;

- -    Consolidation of TI's patent licensees and market conditions reducing
     royalty payments to TI;

- -    Economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which TI, its
     customers or its suppliers operate, including security risks, health
     conditions, possible disruptions in transportation networks and
     fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

- -    Availability of raw materials and critical manufacturing equipment;

- -    TI's ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel;

- -    Fluctuations in the market value of TI's investments and in interest rates;
     and

NEWS RELEASE
C-04041


                 TI UPDATES THIRD-QUARTER 2004 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

- -    Revenue Expected between $3100 Million and $3240 Million
- -    EPS Expected between $0.27 and $0.29

     CONFERENCE CALL ON TI WEB SITE AT 3:30 P.M. CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME TODAY
                                   WWW.TI.COM
                                   ----------


DALLAS (Sept. 8, 2004) - In a scheduled update to its business outlook for the
third quarter of 2004, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE:TXN) today revised
its expected revenue and earnings ranges. This update reflects what TI believes
are adjustments by customers as they move quickly to reduce inventory levels to
more closely match their own end-equipment growth rates. These adjustments are
more aggressive in standard products sold through the distribution channel than
in other areas.

The company's expectations for revenue are:

- -    Total revenue between $3100 million and $3240 million, compared with the
     prior range of $3200 million to $3440 million;

- -    Semiconductor revenue between $2665 million and $2785 million, compared
     with the prior range of $2780 million to $2980 million;

- -    Sensors & Controls revenue between $260 million and $270 million, compared
     with the prior range of $255 million to $275 million; and

- -    Educational & Productivity Solutions revenue between $175 million and $185
     million, compared with the prior range of $170 million to $190 million.

TI expects earnings per share (EPS) between $0.27 and $0.29, compared with the
previous range of $0.26 to $0.29.

The company's revised earnings estimate reflects reduced factory loadings and a
lower expected accrual for profit sharing. Additionally, the effective annual
tax rate has been reduced from 29 percent to 26 percent, primarily due to an
increase in the estimated tax benefit for export sales. Including catch-up
adjustments, the third-quarter effective tax rate is estimated to be about 21
percent.

The company will hold a conference call at 3:30 p.m. CDT today to discuss this
update. This conference call will be available live at www.ti.com. TI's original
third-quarter outlook was published in the company's second-quarter 2004
earnings release on July 20, available at www.ti.com. TI's third quarter ends on
September 30.
